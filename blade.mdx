## Blade Configuration

The blade energy matrix determines the stability, power output, and containment field of your lightsaber. Follow these guidelines for optimal performance.

### Core Settings

```json
{
  "blade": {
    "length": 1.2, // meters
    "diameter": 0.04, // meters
    "containmentField": {
      "strength": 0.95,
      "modulation": "dynamic",
      "frequency": 1000 // Hz
    }
  }
}
```

### Safety Features

- Auto-shutdown on handle release
- Power cycling every 1000 hours
- Emergency containment protocols

<Note>
Regular maintenance and calibration checks are required every 3 standard months.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

Common blade issues and their solutions:

- Flickering blade → Check containment field strength
- Unstable power output → Verify crystal alignment
- Excess heat generation → Adjust modulation frequency

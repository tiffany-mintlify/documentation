## Kyber Crystal Selection

Selecting the right kyber crystal is crucial for optimal lightsaber performance. This guide will help you through the crystal attunement process and basic configuration steps.

### Crystal Attunement

Before beginning the configuration process, ensure your crystal is properly attuned:

- Meditate with the crystal for at least 2 standard galactic hours
- Ensure crystal color alignment matches your Force signature
- Verify crystal resonance frequency (should be between 2.4 and 3.1 GHz)

### Configuration Parameters

```json
{
  "crystal": {
    "resonance": 2.7,
    "alignment": "light | dark",
    "intensity": 0.8,
    "focusMatrix": {
      "x": 0.5,
      "y": 0.5,
      "z": 0.5
    }
  }
}
```

<Warning>
Improper crystal configuration may result in catastrophic lightsaber failure. Always follow proper safety protocols.
